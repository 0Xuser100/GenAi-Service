### Summary of Important Points from Page 15

#### **Impairment of Non-Current Assets**
1. **Assessment for Impairment:**
   - The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired.
   - If evidence of impairment exists or annual impairment testing is required, the Company estimates the asset's recoverable amount.

2. **Recoverable Amount:**
   - The recoverable amount is the higher of:
     - The asset's or cash-generating unit's **fair value less costs to sell**.
     - The **value in use** (estimated future cash flows discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the time value of money and risks).

3. **Impairment Criteria:**
   - If the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset or unit is considered impaired and reduced to its recoverable amount.

4. **Value in Use Calculation:**
   - Future cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks.

5. **Recognition of Impairment Losses:**
   - Impairment losses from continuing operations, including decreases in the value of working capital, are recognized in the statement of profit or loss within expenses.

6. **Reversal of Impairment Losses:**
   - At each reporting date, the Company assesses whether previously recognized impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased.
   - If evidence exists, the recoverable amount is reassessed.
   - A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized.
   - The reversal is recognized in the statement of profit or loss, but the carrying amount of the asset is not increased beyond what it would have been without the impairment loss.

#### **Right of Use Assets and Lease Liabilities**
1. **Recognition of Lease Assets and Liabilities:**
   - The Company recognizes the assets and liabilities of its operating leases.
   - Each lease payment is allocated between liabilities and the cost of financing.

2. **Cost of Financing:**
   - The cost of financing is charged to the profit or loss statement over the lease period to achieve a fixed periodic interest rate on the remaining balance of the obligation.

3. **Right of Use Asset Recognition:**
   - Initially recognized at the present value of future rental payments, adjusted for:
     - Lease payments made before the lease commencement date.
     - Direct costs incurred by the Company as a lessee.
     - Estimated costs for dismantling, removing the asset, and restoring the location.

4. **Measurement of Right of Use Asset:**
   - Subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease obligation.

5. **Depreciation of Right of Use Asset:**
   - Depreciated over the estimated duration of the lease contract using the straight-line method.

6. **Lease Liability Recognition:**
   - Initially recognized at the present value of unpaid lease payments on the start date of the contract.
   - The Company's incremental borrowing rate is used to discount the lease payments.

### Key Takeaways:
- **Impairment Assessment:** Regular assessment for impairment, with assets reduced to their recoverable amount if impaired.
- **Reversal of Impairment:** Reversal of impairment losses is possible if conditions change, but the carrying amount cannot exceed its pre-impairment value.

### Summary of Important Points from Page 16

#### **Right of Use Assets and Lease Liabilities (Continued)**

1. **Initial Recognition of Right-of-Use Assets:**
   - **Recovered Security Deposits:** Security deposits are not included in the initial measurement of right-of-use assets. However, the difference between the nominal value of refunded security deposits and their fair value at the beginning of the lease is treated as an additional lease payment in advance. This difference is added to the initial book value of the right-of-use assets and is depreciated over the lease term.

2. **Subsequent Measurement of Lease Liability:**
   - The lease liability is adjusted over time as follows:
     - **Increase for Interest:** The book amount is increased to reflect interest on the lease obligation.
     - **Reduce for Rental Payments:** The book amount is reduced to reflect rental payments made.
     - **Re-measurement for Changes:** The book amount is re-measured to reflect any revaluation or amendments to the lease contract.

3. **Separation of Lease Payments in Cash Flows:**
   - The company separates the amounts paid into:
     - **Financing Activities:** The original portion of the lease payments.
     - **Operating Activities:** The interest component of the lease payments.

4. **Impairment Testing:**
   - The "Right of Use Assets" are tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 "Impairment of Assets."

     - Periods covered by the lease extension option if the company is reasonably certain of exercising it.
     - Periods covered by the termination option if the company is reasonably certain that this option will not be exercised.

2. **Short-Term Leases and Low-Value Contracts:**
   - For short-term leases (lease term of 12 months or less) and low-value contracts, the company recognizes rental expenses on a straight-line basis, as permitted by IFRS 16. This is consistent with the accounting method under IAS 17 "Leases."

#### **Investment in an Associate**
1. **Definition of an Associate:**
   - An associate is an entity in which the company exerts significant influence but does not have control or joint control. Significant influence is the ability to participate in the investee's financial and operational decisions.

2. **Accounting Method:**
   - The company uses the **equity method** to account for investments in associates:
     - Investments are included in the statement of financial position at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the company's share of the associate's net assets.
     - Goodwill associated with the investment is included in the book value and is not amortized or independently tested for impairment.

3. **Recognition of Results:**
   - The company's share of the results of the associate's operations is included in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
   - Direct changes in the equity of the associate are recognized and disclosed in the statement of changes in equity, if appropriate.
   - Unrealized gains or losses resulting from transactions between the company and the associate are excluded from the company's share of the associate's results.

4. **Financial Statements of Associates:**
   - The financial statements of associates are prepared for the same financial period as the company.
   - Adjustments are made, if necessary, to align the accounting policies of associates with the company's accounting policies.

### Key Takeaways:

### Summary of Important Points from Page 17

#### **Investment in an Associate (Continued)**
1. **Impairment Assessment**:
   - The company assesses the extent of impairment in the value of investments in associates at the date of preparing the financial statements.
   - If impairment evidence exists, the company estimates the recoverable amount of the investment, which is the fair value of the investment or unit producing cash less selling costs or value in use, whichever is lower.

2. **Significant Impact Loss**:
   - If significant impact is lost on an associate, the company measures the recognition of any investments held at fair value.
   - Any difference between the book value of the associates and their fair value is recognized in the separate statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income when the impact is lost.

---

#### **Financial Instruments**
1. **Classification of Financial Assets (IFRS 9)**:
   - IFRS 9 classifies financial assets into three main categories:
     - **Measured at amortized cost**.
     - **Fair value through other comprehensive income**.
     - **Fair value through profit or loss**.
   - This classification is based on the business model through which the financial asset and associated contractual cash flows are managed.
   - The classification excludes the categories in IAS 39 for assets held to maturity, loans, and financial assets available for sale.

2. **Initial Recognition**:
   - Upon initial recognition, financial assets are classified as:
     - **Amortized cost**.
     - **Fair value through other comprehensive income**.
     - **Fair value through profit or loss**.

---

#### **Financial Assets at Amortized Cost**
1. **Conditions for Amortized Cost**:
   - Financial assets are measured at amortized cost if they meet the following conditions:
     - Held within a business model intended to collect contractual cash flows.
     - The contractual terms result in cash flows that are only payments of principal and interest on the outstanding amount.

---

#### **Financial Assets at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income**
1. **Debt Instruments**:
   - A debt instrument is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if it meets the following conditions:
     - Held within a business model that fulfills its purpose by collecting both contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.
     - The contractual terms result in cash flows that are only payments of principal and interest on the outstanding amount.
   - Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are classified as non-current assets in the statement of financial position.

2. **Equity Instruments**:
   - Upon initial recognition of an equity investment not held for trading, the company may irrevocably choose to present subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income. This selection is made on an investment-by-investment basis.

---

#### **Financial Assets at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss**
1. **General Classification**:
   - All other financial assets are classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss.

2. **Irrevocable Identification**:
   - Upon initial recognition, the company may irrevocably identify a financial asset to be measured at amortized cost or fair value through other comprehensive income, as well as fair value through profit or loss, if doing so eliminates or materially reduces accounting incompatibilities.

3. **Reclassification**:
   - Financial assets are not reclassified after initial recognition, except in the period following a change in the company’s business model for managing financial assets.

---

### Key Takeaways:
- **Investment in Associates**: Impairment assessment and fair value measurement when significant impact is lost.
- **Financial Instruments Classification**: IFRS 9 classifies financial assets into three categories based on the business model and cash flow characteristics.
- **Amortized Cost**: Assets held for collecting contractual cash flows.
- **Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income**: Debt instruments held for both collecting cash flows and selling, and equity investments not held for trading.
- **Fair Value Through Profit or Loss**: All other financial assets, with irrevocable identification to eliminate accounting incompatibilities.
- **Reclassification**: Limited to periods following changes in the business model for managing financial assets.

### Summary of Important Points from Page 18

#### **Financial Instruments (Continued)**
1. **Financial Liabilities:**
   - **IFRS 9 Retains Classification Requirements:** IFRS 9 largely retains the classification requirements of IAS 39 for financial liabilities.
   - **Fair Value Changes:**
     - Changes in fair value attributable to changes in liability credit risk are recognized in other comprehensive income.
     - The remaining changes in fair value are recognized in the profit or loss statement.
   - **Measurement:**
     - Financial liabilities are initially measured at amortized cost.
     - Subsequently, they are measured at amortized cost unless required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss under IFRS 9.

#### **Inventory**
1. **Measurement:**
   - Inventory is measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
   - **Cost:** Includes expenses incurred to bring the product to its current location and state, determined on a weighted average basis.
   - **Net Realizable Value (NRV):** Based on the estimated selling price less any additional costs expected upon completion or sale.
   - **Provision for Obsolete Inventory:** A provision is made for obsolete and slow-moving inventory if necessary.

#### **Related Parties**
1. **Definition:**
   - A related party is a person or entity related to the Company, including:
     - Individuals with control or significant influence over the Company.
     - Members of the main management.
     - Entities that are part of the same group (e.g., parent, subsidiary, associate, joint venture).
   - Transactions with related parties involve the transfer of resources, services, or obligations, regardless of whether a price is charged.
   - Key management personnel have direct or indirect control over the Company's operations.

#### **Account Receivables**
1. **Measurement:**
   - Account receivables are stated at the original amount of the bill, less an allowance for uncollectible amounts.
   - **Expected Credit Loss Provision:** Recognized when there is objective evidence that the Company cannot collect amounts due according to the original terms.
   - **Bad Debts:** Written off against the related allocations and charged to the profit or loss statement.
   - **Recoveries:** Subsequent recoveries of previously written-off receivables are added to other revenue.

#### **Decrease in the Value of Financial Assets**
1. **Impairment Requirements (IFRS 9):**
   - IFRS 9 uses a forward-looking approach to recognize expected credit losses, known as the "expected credit loss model."
   - **Key Changes:**
     - Credit losses are no longer recognized based on the Company initially identifying a credit loss event.
     - Instead, the Company considers a broader range of information, including past events, current conditions, and reasonable forecasts, to assess credit risk and measure expected credit losses.
   - **Stages of Credit Loss:**
     - **Stage 1:** Financial instruments whose credit quality has not declined significantly since initial recognition or that contain low credit risk.
     - **Stage 2:** Financial instruments whose credit quality has declined significantly since initial recognition and whose credit risk is not low.
     - **Stage 3:** Financial assets with objective evidence of impairment at the reporting date. None of the Company's assets fall into this category.

### Key Takeaways:
- **Financial Liabilities:** Changes in fair value are split between profit or loss and other comprehensive income based on credit risk.
- **Inventory:** Measured at the lower of cost or NRV, with provisions for obsolete inventory.
- **Related Parties:** Defined broadly, including transactions with entities or individuals with control or influence.
- **Account Receivables:** Measured net of expected credit losses, with bad debts written off and recoveries recognized.
- **Impairment (IFRS 9):** Forward-looking approach to recognize expected credit losses, categorized into three stages, with none of the Company's assets in Stage 3.

### Summary of Important Points from Page 20

#### **1. Provisions**
- **Recognition**: Provisions are recognized when there are liabilities (legal or foreseeable) resulting from past events, and the costs of repayment are probable and reliably measurable.
- **Measurement**: The amount of a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the liability at the end of the financial statement period, considering risks and uncertainties.
- **Discounting**: If the provision is measured using estimated cash flows, the present value of these cash flows is used when the time value of money is material. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as financing costs.
- **Recoverable Benefits**: If economic benefits are expected to be recovered from another party, a receivable is recognized as an asset when receipt is virtually certain and the amount can be measured reliably.

---

#### **2. Zakat**
- **Recognition**: The Zakat provision is recognized at the end of each fiscal year in accordance with the regulations of the Zakat, Tax, and Customs Authority of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

---

#### **5. Revenue Recognition**
- **Measurement**: Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties.
- **Recognition Criteria**: Revenue is recognized when the Company transfers control over a product or service to a customer. The principles in IFRS 15 are applied using the following five steps:
  1. **Defining the Contract**: A contract is defined as an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights or obligations and defines the criteria that must be met.
  2. **Defining Performance Obligations**: A performance obligation is a promise to transfer a good or provide a service.
  3. **Determining the Transaction Price**: The transaction price is the amount of consideration expected to be received for transferring the promised goods or services, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties.
  4. **Allocating the Transaction Price**: For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the amount of consideration expected to be received for fulfilling all commitments.
  5. **Recognizing Revenue**: Revenue is recognized when (or as) the entity satisfies the performance obligation.

### Summary of Important Points from Page 21

#### **Revenue Recognition (Continued)**
1. **Revenue Recognition Criteria**:
   - Revenue is recognized when the performance obligations are fulfilled, i.e., when the service is provided to the customer.
   - Performance obligations are promises to provide services to the customer.
   - Upon fulfillment, revenue is recorded at the fair value of the benefit provided, excluding amounts collected on behalf of external parties and price discounts.

2. **Service Invoices with Multiple Services**:
   - If a service invoice includes different services, the invoice price is allocated proportionally.
   - Revenue is recognized upon fulfilling the performance obligations and providing the service to the customer.
   - The company provides services directly and is not considered an agent for other parties.

#### **Define Contracts with the Client**
3. **Contract Assessment**:
   - The company conducts a detailed assessment of contracts with clients to ensure revenue is recognized only when performance obligations are fulfilled.
   - Changes in contract scope or price are treated as contract amendments.
   - The company determines whether such changes constitute a new contract or are accounted for as part of the current contract.
   - The impact of contract modifications on the transaction price is substantiated.

#### **Define Performance Obligations**
4. **Identifying Performance Obligations**:
   - After identifying the contract, the company assesses the contractual terms and usual business practices to identify all agreed-upon services.
   - It determines which of these services are treated as separate performance obligations.

#### **Determining the Transaction Price**
5. **Transaction Price Calculation**:
   - The transaction price is the amount the company expects to receive.
   - It includes estimates of variable consideration, the time value of money, and the fair value of non-cash consideration.
   - Variable consideration is constrained to amounts with a high probability of not resulting in significant revenue reversals when uncertainties are resolved.

#### **Allocation of Transaction Price**
6. **Allocating the Transaction Price**:
   - The transaction price is allocated to performance obligations based on their standalone selling prices (relative standalone selling price basis).
   - If standalone selling prices are not directly observable, the company uses observable or reasonably available information.

#### **Revenue Recognition**
7. **Timing of Revenue Recognition**:
   - Revenue is recognized only when the company satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a promised service to the customer.
   - Control may transfer over time or at a specific point in time.
   - For performance obligations satisfied over time, the company determines progress using the input or output method, which provides the best measure of progress.
   - The chosen method is consistently applied to similar performance obligations.

### Key Takeaways:
- Revenue is recognized upon fulfilling performance obligations.
- Contracts are meticulously assessed, and changes are treated as amendments.
- Performance obligations are identified based on contractual terms and business practices.
- The transaction price includes estimates of variable consideration and is allocated based on standalone selling prices.
- Revenue recognition is consistent and aligned with the transfer of control to the customer.

### **Revenue Recognition (continued)**
- **Sales of Goods**: Revenue is recognized when the goods are delivered, and the significant rewards and risks of ownership have passed to the buyer. This typically occurs at the time of delivery, as it is the point at which the amount is unconditional, and only the passage of time is required before payment is due.
- **Return Policy**: The Company does not grant customers the right to return products within a limited period. Returns are recorded after management reviews and are accepted only for defects or deviations from the specified order by the customer.
- **Other Income**: Other income is recognized when it is realized.

### **Cost of Revenue**
- The cost of revenue includes all direct operating expenses directly related to generating revenue, including costs of services from external sources (if any), such as maintenance.
