WORK EXPERIENCE
AI Engineer
ThinkTech Company jun 2025 - Ongoing
Designed and deployed a production-grade Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) service that ingests
PDFs/XLSX/docs (local or Google Drive), runs OCR + embedding pipelines, and serves structured financial insights
via FastAPI APIs.
Implemented a job queue architecture with background threads to handle multi-analysis requests, stream progress,
and persist results as JSON for polling endpoints.
Built modular pipelines for document ingestion, OCR (YOLO + PaddleOCR + Tesseract), and LangChain-based
chunking, feeding embeddings into Qdrant vector stores.
Standardized outputs with Pydantic schemas and prompt templates to ensure multi-lingual, structured JSON
responses for downstream systems.
Integrated Tavily/Exa web agents and financial-specific analyses (ratios, entity background, bank statements) into
RetrievalQA chains.
Dockerized and CI/CD-enabled (Azure Pipelines) deployment, with configurable concurrency , monitoring hooks,
and storage cleanup utilities.
Tools & Technologies:
• Python, FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pydantic, LangChain, LangSmith, Langfuse, OpenAI GPT-4.1/GPT-5 APIs, OpenAI
embeddings, Qdrant, FAISS, PyMuPDF, Unstructured, pdfplumber, PaddleOCR, Ultralytics YOLO (DocLayNet),
