a) During financial year 2021, Aman Insurance Agency Company (the Company) applied for its 
license renewal from Saudi Central Bank (“SAMA”), however, it was not renewed, as SAMA 
had issued rules governing bancassurance activities during May 2020 which require the banks to 
carry out Bancassurance business directly. This, as a result, restricted the ability of the Company 
to carry out business activities and therefore, management of the Company decided to initiate the 
winding up procedures which are in process as at 31 March 2024. 
 
b) The Group invests in structured entities with the objective to resell the investment in a shor t 
period after the establishment. Structured entities are consolidated when the relationship between 
the Group and the structured entity indicates that the Group has power over the relevant activities 
of the structured entity, is exposed to variable returns, and can use that power to affect the variable 
return exposure. In other cases, the Group may sponsor or have exposure to such an entity but 
not consolidate the entities. 
 
As at 31 March 2024, the Group has a substantial ownership in these entities amoun ting to SR 
1,156.47 million (31 December 202 3: SR 1,113.98 million and 31 March 2023 : SR 1,160.13 
million). For all these investments, the Group analyses whether and to what extent it controls the 
investee and any underlying entities. A material structured entity is consolidated into the Group’s 
financial statements where the Group controls the structured entity, as per the determination 
above criteria. As at 31 March 2024, Group’s investments in material structured entities do not 
meet the above criteria of control. Accordingly, such investments are recorded as fair value 
through statement of income (FVIS) into this interim condensed consolidated financial 
information. 
 
2. BASIS OF PREPARATION 
 
The interim condensed consolidated financial information of the Group as at and for the period 
ended 31 March 2024, has been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 
34 Interim Financial Reporting ( “IAS 34”) that is endorsed in the Kin gdom of Saudi Arabia and 
other standards and pronouncements issued by the Saudi Organization for Chartered and 
Professional Accountants (“SOCPA”).  
 
This interim condensed consolidated financial information does not include all of the information 
required for full annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Group ’s 
annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023. The consolidated 
financial statements of the Group as at and for the year ended 31 December 2023, were prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) that are endorsed in the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other standards and pronouncements issued by SOCPA.

(UNAUDITED) 
FOR THE THREE-THREE PERIOD ENDED 31 MARCH 2024 (CONTINUED)

2. BASIS OF PREPARATION (continued) 
 
The preparation of interim condensed consolidated financial information requires management to 
make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual results may differ from 
these estimates. 
 
In preparing th is interim condensed consolidated financial information, significant judgements 
made by the management in applying the Group’s accounting policies and the key sources of 
estimation were consistent with those that were applied to the consolidated financial statements as 
at and for the year ended 31 December 2023, except for new amendments that are applicable from 
the period beginning 1 January 2024 as disclosed in note 4(a). 
 
This interim condensed consolidated financial information is expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals 
(SR) and is rounded off to the nearest thousands except where otherwise stated and the functional 
currency of the Bank is Saudi Riyal.  
 
The new Companies Law issued through Royal Decree M/132 on 1/12/1443H (corresponding to 
30 June 2022) (hereinafter referred as "the Law”) came into force on 26/6/1444H (corresponding 
to 19 January 2023). For certain provisions of the Law, full compliance is expected not later than 
two years from 26/6/1444H (corresponding to 19 January 2023). The management is in process of 
assessing the impact of the New Companies Law and will amend its by -laws for any changes to 
align the by-laws to the provisions of the Law. Consequently, the Bank shall present the amended 
by-laws to the shareholders in their Extraordinary / Annual General Assembly meeting for their 
ratification. 
 
3.  BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION 
 
This interim condensed consolidated financial information comprises the interim condensed 
financial statements of Bank AlJazira and its subsidiaries as set out in Note 1. The financial 
information of the subsidiaries is prepared for the same reporting period as that of the Bank.  
 
The interim condensed consolidated financial information has been prepared using uniform 
accounting policies and valuation methods for like transactions and other events in similar 
circumstances. The accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed when necessary to align 
them with the policies adopted by the Group. 
 
a) Subsidiaries  
 
Subsidiaries are entities which are controlled by the Bank. The Bank controls an entity when it is 
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability 
to affect those returns through its power over the entity. To meet the definition of control, all of 
the following three criteria must be met: 
 
i. the Group has power over an entity;  
ii. the Group has exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity; 
and  
iii. the Group has the ability to use its power over the entity to affect the amount of the entity’s 
returns.

(UNAUDITED) 
FOR THE THREE-THREE PERIOD ENDED 31 MARCH 2024 (CONTINUED) 
11 
 
3.  BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION (continued) 
 
The Group re -assesses whether or not it controls an investee in case facts and circumstances 
indicate that there are changes to one or more of the criteria of control. 
 
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease 
to be consolidated from the date on which the control is transferred from the Group. The results of 
subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period, if any, are included in the interim condensed 
consolidated statement of income from the date of the acquisition or up to the dat e of disposal, as 
appropriate. 
 
b) Non-controlling interests 
 
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of net income and net assets of subsidiaries not 
owned, directly or indirectly, by the Group in its subsidiaries and are presented separately in the 
interim condensed consolidated statement of income and within equity in the interim condensed 
consolidated statement of financial position, separately from the Bank’s equity. Any losses 
applicable to the non -controlling interests in a subsidiary are alloca ted to the non -controlling 
interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance. Changes in 
the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity 
transactions. 
 
c) Transactions eliminated on consolidation 
 
Balances between the Group entities, and any unrealized income and expenses (except for foreign 
currency transaction gains or losses) arising from intra -group transactions, are eliminated in 
preparing the interim condense d consolidated financial information. Unrealized losses are 
eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of 
impairment. 
 
d) Investment in an associate 
 
Associates are entities over which the Group exercises significant influence. Investments in 
associates are initially recognized at cost and subsequently accounted for under the equity method 
of accounting and are carried in the interim condensed consolidated statement of financial position 
at the lower of the equity-accounted value or the recoverable amount. 
 
Equity-accounted value represents the cost plus post -acquisition changes in the Group’s share of 
net assets of the associate (share of the results, reserves and accumulated gains/ (losses) based  on 
the latest available financial information) less impairment, if any. 
 
After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise 
an additional impairment loss on its investment in its associates. The Group determi nes at each 
reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is 
impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference 
between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognises the amount 
in ‘share in net income / (loss) of an associate’ in the interim condensed consolidated statement of 
income.

3.  BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION (continued) 
 
The previously recognized impairment loss in respect of investment in associate can be reversed 
through the interim condensed consolidated statement of income, such that the carrying amount of 
the investment in the interim condensed consolidated statement of financial position remains at the 
lower of the equity-accounted (before allowance for impairment) or the recoverable amount. 
 
Unrealized gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to 
the extent of the Group’s interest in the associates. 
 
4. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS 
 
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the interim condensed consolidated financial 
information are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Group’s annual 
consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023, except for the adoption of 
new standards effective as of 1 January 2024. Several amendments apply for the first time in 2024

analysis.

Amendment to IAS 1 
– Non-current

These amendments clarify how conditions with which an entity

9. SHARIAH COMPLIANT DERIVATIVES  
 
9.1 Nature/type of derivatives held 
 
In the ordinary course of business, the Group utilizes the following Shari’ah compliant derivative 
financial instruments for both trading and strategic hedging purposes: 
 
a) Swaps 
 
Swaps are commitments to exchange one set of cash flows for another. For profit rate 
swaps, counterparties generally exchange fixed and floating rate profit payments in a single 
currency without exchanging principal. For cross -currency profit rate swaps, principal, 
fixed and floating profit payments are exchanged in different currencies. 
 
b) Options (Wa’ad Fx) 
 
Foreign exchange options are transactions, whereby a client, in consideration for the 
payment of a fee agrees to enter into one or a series of trades in which one party (promisor) 
gives a commitment as a unilateral undertaking, to a second party (promisee). 
 
An option can be a unilateral promise or combinati on of promises. The Group enters into 
the option depending on the client ’s risk profile, whereby the client may promise to buy, 
sell or buy and sell a currency with or without conditions for hedging its exposure. 
 
9.2 Purpose of derivatives 
 
a) Held for trading purposes 
 
Most of the Group’s derivative trading activities relate to sales, positioning and arbitrage. 
Sales activities involve offering products to customers in order, to enable them to transfer, 
modify or reduce current and future risks. Positioning involves managing market risk 
positions with the expectation of profiting from favourable movements in prices, rates or 
indices. Arbitrage involves identifying, with the expectation of profiting from, price 
differentials between markets or products. 
 
b) Held for hedging purposes 
 
The Group uses Shari’ah compliant derivatives for hedging purposes in order to reduce its 
exposure to profit rate risk and foreign exchange risk.  
 
The Group has adopted a comprehensive system for the measurement and management of 
risk. Part of the risk management process involves managing the Group ’s exposure to 
fluctuations in foreign exchange and profit rates to reduce its exposure to currency and 
profit rate risks to acceptable levels as determined by the Board of Directors wi thin the 
guidelines issued by Saudi Central Bank. 
 
As part of its financial asset and liability management, the Group uses Shari’ah compliant 
derivatives for hedging purposes in order to adjust its own exposure to currency and profit  
rate risk. This is generally achieved by hedging specific transactions.

9.2 Purpose of derivatives (continued) 
 
b) Held for hedging purposes (continued) 
 
Cash flow hedges 
 
The Group is exposed to variability in future cash flows on non-trading assets and liabilities 
which bear profit at a variable rate. The Group uses profit rate swaps as cash flow hedges 
of these profit rate risks.  
 
The (losses) / gains on cash flow hedges reclassified to the interim condensed consolidated 
statement of income during the period are as follows: 
 
The cash flow hedges of profit rate swap were highly effective in offsetting the variability 
of return on investments, deposits and other financial liabilities.  
 
Fair value gain on cash flow hedges amounting to SR 47.88 million (31 March 2023: loss 
of SR 55.86 million) included in the interim condensed consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income comprised of net unrealized loss of SR 49.95 million (31 March 
2023: net unrealized loss of SR 67.99 million) and net realized gain of SR 97.82 million 
(31 March 2023: net realized gain of SR 12.13 million) on terminated hedge relationships. 
 
During the current and prior periods, the Group sold certain of its profit rate swaps used for 
cash flows hedges. However, the gain / (loss) would continue to be classified in interim 
condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income as the related hedge items are 
still outstanding. In accordance with the IFRS requirements, the gain / (loss) will be 
reclassified to interim condensed consolidated statement of income in the period when the 
cash flows pertaining to hedged items will affect the interim condensed consolidated 
statement of income i.e. when profit receipts / payments impact the interim condensed 
consolidated statement of income which is over the rem aining maturity of financial 
instrument / hedge items.  
 
9.3 Details of shar’iah compliant derivatives 
 
The table below summarize the positive and negative fair values of the Group’s derivative 
financial instruments, together with their notional amounts. The notional amounts, which 
provide an indication of the volume of transactions outstanding at the end of the period, do 
not necessarily reflect the amounts of future cash flows involved. These notional amounts, 
therefore, are neither indicative of the Group’s exposure to credit risk, which is generally 
limited to the positive fair value of the derivatives, nor market risk.

10. SUBORDINATED SUKUK 
 
On 8 December 2021, the Bank issued 2,000 Subordinated Sukuk Certificates (Sukuk) of SR 1 
million each, with a profit distribution rate based on 6 month Saudi Inter -Bank Offered Rate 
(SIBOR), reset semi-annually in advance, plus a margin of 155 basis point per annum and payable 
semi-annually in arrears on 8 December  and 8 June each year until 8 December 2031, on which 
date the Sukuk will expire. The Bank has a call option which can be exercised on or after 8 
December 2026 on meeting certain conditions and as per the terms mentioned in the related offering 
circular. The Sukuk may also be called upon occurrence of certain other conditions as per the terms 
specified in the offering circular. These Sukuk are registered with Saudi Exchange (Tadawul). 
 
11. SHARE CAPITAL AND EARNINGS PER SHARE 
 
The authorized, issued and fully paid share capital of the Bank consists of 820 million shares of 
SR 10 each (31 December 2023: 820 million shares of SR 10 each and 31 March 2023: 820 million 
shares of SR 10 each). The Board of Directors had proposed a bonus issue of 1 bonus shares for 
every 4 shares held by the shareholders  which has been approved in the shareholders’ Extra 
Ordinary General Assembly Meeting held on April 24, 20 24 subsequent to the date of the 
condensed interim consolidated financial information. Consequently, the Bank’s updated paid-up 
share capital will be 1,025 million shares of SR 10 each. These changes will be incorporated into 
the Group’s condensed interim consolidated financial information in the subsequent quarter. 
 
The weighted average number of shares has been retrospectively adjusted for prior period to reflect 
the effect of the changes in number of shares due to issue of bonus shares subsequent to period 
end. 
 
Basic earnings per share for the current and prior period is calculated by dividing the net income 
for the period attributable to common equity holders of the Bank (adjusted for Tier 1 sukuk related 
costs) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, as follows:

During the year 2020, the Bank received VAT assessment for the years 2018 and 2019 with an 
additional VAT of SR 39.3 million and associated delay fines amounting to SR 63.9 million. The 
Bank objected to the imposition of additional VAT and associated delay fines with the Tax Violation 
and Dispute Resolution Committee [TVDRC] as a result of which one of the assessment point was 
dropped by ZATCA which resulted in a reduction of the overall liability to approximately SR 37 
million. The Bank lodged another objection against the decision rendered by TVDRC with the Tax 
Violation and Dispute Appeal Committee [TVDAC] on the remaining assessment points and awaits 
for the decision. Subsequently, however, the Bank decided to settle the additional tax of SR 39.3 
million “under protest” in order to avail the amnesty so that associated delay fines are waived. 
 
The Bank has filed its zakat and income tax returns with the ZATCA and paid zakat and income tax 
for the years up to and including the year 2023.

17. FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value 
measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction takes place either: 
 
a) in the accessible principal market for the asset or liability, or 
b) in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantages accessible market for the asset 
or liability. 
Determination of fair value and fair value hierarchy 
 
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial 
instruments: 
Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  
Level 2:  Inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable either directly 
(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). This category includes 
instruments valued using: quoted market prices in active markets for similar 
instruments; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are 
considered less than active or other valuation techniques in which all significant 
inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data  
Level 3:  Inputs that are unobserva ble. This category includes all instruments for which the 
valuation technique include inputs that are not observable and the unobservable inputs 
have a significant effect on the instrument’s valuation. This category includes 
instruments that are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments for which 
significant unobservable adjustments or assumptions are required to reflect 
differences between the instruments” 
 
For assets and liabilities that are recognised at fair value on a recurring basis, the Group determines 
whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re -assessing categorization 
(based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the 
end of each reporting period.  
 
There were no changes in the Group’s valuation processes, valuation techniques, and types of 
inputs used in the fair value measurements during the period.

Fair value of quoted investments is based on price quoted on the reporting date. Level 2 trading 
and hedging derivatives comprise foreign exchange, options  and profit rate swaps. These foreign 
exchange contracts have been fair valued using forward exchange rates that are quoted in an active 
market. Profit rate swaps and wa'ad options are fair valued using forward profit rates extracted 
from observable yield curves. The effects of discounting are generally insignificant for Level 2 
derivatives. 
 
There were no changes in valuation techniques during the period. 
 
There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 during the period. New investments acquired during 
the period are classified under the relevant levels. Level 3 includes investment in unquoted equities 
which have been valued using a valuation model.

18. CAPITAL ADEQUACY 
 
The Group's objectives when managing capital are to comply with the capital requirements set by SAMA 
to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern and to maintain a strong capital base. 
 
Capital adequacy and the use of regulatory capital are monitored on a periodic basis by the Bank’s 
management. SAMA requires holding the minimum level of the regulatory capital and maintaining a ratio 
of total eligible capital to the risk-weighted assets at or above the agreed minimum percentage. 
 
The Group monitors the adequacy of its capital using ratios established by SAMA. These ratios measure 
capital adequacy by comparing the Group's eligible capital with its interim condensed consolidated 
statement of financial position assets, commitments and notional amount of derivatives at a weighted 
amount to reflect their relative risk. 
 
The current period numbers are presented as per Basel IV regulation issued by SAMA (circular number 
44047144) effective from January 01, 2023, while the prior period is based on Basel III regulations. 
 
The following table summarizes the Bank's Pillar-I Risk Weighted Assets (RWA), Regulatory Capital and
